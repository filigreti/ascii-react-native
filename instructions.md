To install,
1. Run the server with npm run start, and make sure you can access the api at port 3000
2. Run react-native run-android on the creatella folder assuming you have react-native cli installed on the system
3. Access the app.js file and use the local ip of your system(it didnt allow loacalhost for some strange reason  ) so for windows (ipconfig on terminal ) and mac (go to your network preferences in settings and copy the ip shown). Ps... never knew this was an issue, most endpoints i consumed where always links.
eg (http://192.168.100.103:3000/products/api/products)
4. I was able to complete all of the task assigned minus (two).. and to a point i feel dissapointed, coming back to react native after so many months has been quite challenging.

First issue: is the dropdown option for sorting, for some strange reason flatlist failed to updateafte state has been changed. This issue took most of my time, cause all others were done since tuesday.

Second Issue: was the advertisement(not an issue- i would have been able to append the ads but that would have required more time)

Overall, switching back to native has been challenging for me, eversince i started using vue-js. That has been my comfort zone, i also apologoize for not finishing the task assigned,
